#Arithmetic Practice: Write a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. 
#Define the two numbers as variables within the code and print the results for each operation.


a=22.5
b=5

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a/b)
print(a*b)
print(a//b)
print(a**b)
print(a%b)
print(a+b-a/b*a//b**a%b)
